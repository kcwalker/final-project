      <p>
        The American Revolution (more a double revolution, one to esablish independence,
        and later to establish a viable government)is the first major watershed moment in what would become
        the United States. This class will examine the causes, major players, and effects that
        went with this momentous anti-colonial movement, and how it would inspire others like it, 
        such as in France,  Haiti (both of which we will discuss to a degree), and Spanish America shortly thereafter. </p>
      </p>
      <p>Course Goals:</p>
      <p>Students enrolled in the class should be able to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the key players in this tumultuous period</li>
        <li>Be able to examine the roles European geopolitics and Enlightenmnt principles played</li>
        <li>Examine the roles women, blacks (both free and unfree), and lower class people played in 
        securing American freedom (and their own, if possible)</li>
        <li>Discuss the efforts to secure the blessings of liberty (and for whom and why) during the Constitutiinal
        Convention</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Attendance is required. Four unexcused absences will result in a lowered grade. Six unexcused absences
      will result in failure of the class (Illness, religious observances and jury duty are no problem; just bring documentation). 
      I expect you to come to class ready to discuss the material, and since we are adults, 
      be mindful and respectful of your classmates. Please, no cell phones, and while I have no 
      problem with computers in the class, refrain from social media.</p>
      <p>Evaluation:</p>
      <p>There will be weekly reaction papers (1-2pp.) and two papers (6-8 pp.) due roughly 5 weeks apart. There
      will also be a in-class final exam.</p>
      <p>Academic integrity:
      I understand that this is may be a difficult class and it will be writing intensive, but I expect everyone to
      be aware of the University's Honor Code. Cheating and plagiarism are serious and idiotic offenses. Even if you
      are cleared of the accusations, it can take years to clear the matter. So why risk it? If you have any questions
      concerning the code, feel free to contact either the dean's office or me. Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
